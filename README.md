# ðŸ§© Sudoku Solver â€“ Java OOP Desktop Application

**Sudoku Solver** is a Java desktop app with a graphical user interface that automatically solves valid Sudoku puzzles. Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, this program allows users to input puzzles, see multiple possible solutions, and even play Sudoku interactively.

Through this project, I explored the limitations of simple algorithms and naive recursion techniques while improving problem-solving and GUI development skills.

Features include:
- ðŸ§  Automatic solving of Sudoku puzzles
- ðŸ”„ Display of multiple possible solutions when available
- ðŸŽ® Interactive gameplay mode to solve puzzles manually
